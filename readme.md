# Day Night Year

This project explores the concepts of time, including day, night, and year cycles to simulate a live desktop wallpaper. This wallpaper shifts between day and night based to system time, and a big text floating at the center depicting the current year.

During the day, there is a blue clear sky with a bright yellow sun, and big black text depicting the year floats on the screen.

During the night, there are twinkling tiny stars on a black sky and a white moon that moves from top to bottom of the screen, depending on todays day. 1st of a month means the moon is on the top, and on the last day it goes out. A big white text depicting the year floats on the screen depicting the year.
